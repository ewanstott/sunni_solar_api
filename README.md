**SOLAR API PROJECT**
-----------------------------------------------
**Brief:** 
Make a website using APIs and vanilla JS. Project done whilst completing the jump digital's full-stack course.

**Description:** 
The goal of the project was to practice both vanilla JavaScript and using APIs to retrieve data.

**APIs:** 
- Googles Solar API: this allowed me to retrieve solar related data (official documentaion [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/solar)) 
- Googles Geocoding/Places API: this allowed me to retrieve latitude and longitude coordinates, to provide place search results and enable autocomplete features for different search types
- Google Maps API: this allowed me to show users location in the DOM whilst demonstrating possible solar panels setups for their homes.

**Things to Improve:** 
- Styling: As the task was predomintely focussed on JavaScript and API use, there is room to improve the styleing. I plan to return to and improve this in the future.
- Layout: I would like to improve this and make it more consistent and responsive.
- CSS to SCSS: I plan to refactor the CSS to SCSS to increase efficiency and reduce file size.
- Imagery: Next steps would be to apply solar data layers to google maps and show sun/shade hours (and potential power output) through a heat map e.g.
